# ROBOTIC VEHICLE USING IOT FOR LANDMINE DETECTION
The land mine crisis is globally alarming since there are presently 500 million unexploded, buried mines in about 70 countries. Governments are looking into this situation seriously since land mines are claiming the lives of civilians every day. The purpose of this project is to design a robot which is capable of detecting buried land mines and marking their locations, while enabling the operator to control the robot wirelessly from a distance.

## Objective of The Project

* The purpose is to give an efficient solution of the landmines problem by using a tele-mobile robot that are capable of exploring buried landmines.
* To construct a simple & cost-effective design for The Robotic Vehicle.
* To provide high reliability of mine detection.
* To use less power & to have battery power in the vehicle that can last for a running time of minimum 2 hours.
* To utilize remote control android application which is wirelessly connect with the vehicle can function at a distance of 20 to 25 meters.
* To Reduce the number of human casualties due to demining operations.
